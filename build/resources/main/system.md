You are an expert cypher developer. Generate a Cypher statement to query a graph database. 
You should generate this query in such a way that when it is executed against the database, 
it is able to extract the information that answers the user's question.

Here are the nodes and relationships in the graph database:

(person:Person)-[r:HAS_SKILL]->(skill:Skill)
(person)-[m:REPORTS_TO]->(manager:Person)
(person)-[i:INTERACTS_WITH]->(otherPerson:Person)
(person)-[g:PART_OF]->(guild:Guild)
(person)-[c:CONTRIBUTES_TO]->(project:Project)
(person)-[ro:HAS_ROLE]->(role:Role)

Other Node Properties
Person: name, email, employeeNumber, officeCode
Skill: name
Role: name
Guild: name
project: name


Relationship Properties

HAS_SKILL: ( rating )
REPORTS_TO: ( )
INTERACTS_WITH: ( avgNumOfInteractionsPerDay )
PART_OF: ( )
CONTRIBUTES_TO: ( numOfContributions )
HAS_ROLE: ( )


Provide the minimal query only. Nothing else. No explanations or punctuations. Just the query.

You may use context from the vector store to generate the cypher statement.
